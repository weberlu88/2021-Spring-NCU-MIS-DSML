6236,this can opener is the smoothest manual can opener i have ever used .,1

6248,the pocket is nice and can certainly hold a few credit cards etc .,1
6249,"when dealing with something of that nature ,  finding a single and complete remedy is very difficult to accomplish .",0
6250,seems like they are being made in multiple overseas sweet shops with little quality control .,0

8060,"however ,  the remaining num_num that were fine ,  were very nice glasses .",1
8061,"well ,  while searching for something else at amazon ,  i stumbled upon this little baby .",1
8062,we still had the medium to compare it too .,0
8063,also purchased a set for my mil and she absolutely loves them .,1
8064,"what it tastes like is very dry ,  and papery .",0
8065,i like the look and feel of this product and it protects it nicely .,1
8066,just because it didnt work for me doesn t mean it won t work for you .,0
8067,supposedly the new zagg batteries fixed this problem .,1
8068,"wee ,  woohoo ,  yippee !  you learn to fly the planes with the greatest of ease ,  and zip through the storyline .",0
8069,it s really bulky also which i didn t like .,0
8070,but the soles wore out far too quickly .,0
8071,it doesn t freeze well so it is not soothing on her teeth .,0
8072,"there is no smell ,  which is great ,  but i cant tell what it s doing .",0
8073,you still get that ginger flavor without the added calories and sugar !  .,0
8074,now i have started to buy the attachments .,1
8075,"the lid is metal and plastic ,  fits nicely ,  and the plunger hasn t failed me yet .",1
8076,so i immediately purchased both the memo center and the separate pencil cup .,1
8077,a major dissapointment .  . unlike amazon . com to carry this type of infearior product .,0
8078,i am not unhappy about my purchase though .,1
8079,this item doesn t let you hang up the phone when the phone call has ended .,0
8080,i had to order this one online but it was well worth it !  .,1
8081,is is a small cutting board for quick uses .,1
8082,"this kracker had me hooked when i first started buying them ,  but they have really gone downhill .",0
8083,"no volume whatsoever ,  and if you apply it to your lower lashes you still can t even see them .",0
8084,"but if you re wanting a small bag ,  this is great .",0
8085,"in fact ,  i have garden tools i inherited from uncles long dead ,  so they are lasting two lifetimes .",0
8086,deosnt fit into ipod as easy as the stock usb plug either .,0

8094,"i ve made three different types ,  and the light rye is my favorite .",1
8095,this is fun for our daughter to play with .,0

8097,"since i have a white iphone ,  i wanted a white phone charger for my car .",1
8098,i should have done more research and i hope that you will .,0
8099,"also ,  the laser is recoil sensitive and will dim or shut off when in use .",0
8100,this little tool is much more useful than the image and description let on .,1
8101,"i flashbacked to a bra i had previously ordered ,  wore once ,  and threw away because of the same problem .",0
8102,so i loaded up the other num_num sw modules and went about trying to find the bushnell s pictures .,0
8103,this lcd comes with a plastic film over it to protect the screen .,1
8104,i reviewed a skin cream called just carrots and i love the aroma but other reviewers didn t .,0

8111,i found this stuff to be too sweet for a curry .,0
8112,i grew up in a farm family where canning was survival .,1
8113,i m writing this review to warn you to check the dimensions .,1
8114,it works perfectly and uses a lot less water than conventional water bath canners .,1
8115,i would return them but i am so tired of businesses selling junk .,0
8116,not real useful if items can fall out as you are putting the bag on or taking it off .,0
8117,the put me in mind of those fried potato sticks in the can as far as taste is concerned .,0
8118,and the smell was much better than the alternative . but the residue it left was horrible .,0
8119,"it does require num_num aa batteries ,  but they are included . i need to comment on the packaging .",0
8120,the tangerine overpowered the orange and left a bad taste in my mouth .,0
8121,it saved my phone when it was knocked in the bath by my num_num yo son .,1

8145,very convenient as you use it like sugar .,0
8146,usually takes at least num_num to num_num attempts to get even a moderate seal .,0
8147,"the ability to see long distance ,  including the night sky ,  was why i purchased these .",0
8148,the fact that a major component of this toy is defective is irresponsible of hasbro .,0
8149,i have not trouble pressing on the ipod and the touch screen works with the screen protector just fine .,1
8150,i owned my older kodak camera for about num_num years and that is much better than this one .,0

8170,please remember this is one person s opinion and ymmv .,0
8171,"hey everyone ,  i just had to take a moment and share my thoughts on the bookbook .",1

8175,"for instance ,  the vertical orientation of the screen is utterly annoying .",0
8176,it s working fine and i rather enjoy having the percolater type maker back again .,1
8177,hopefully amazon will remove this stain from their num_extend party sellers in the near future .,0

8711,"even though they said they fit my model ,  i still checked the measurements .",0

8715,"extremely disappointed in this poor quality ,  yet expensive ,  coffee maker .",0
