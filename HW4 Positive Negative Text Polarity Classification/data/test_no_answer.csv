2,"the price was good ,  and came quickly though my prime membership .",
3,i was looking forward to this game for a couple of num_extend,
4,arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie .,

6,anyway i recommend this one for its price and quality .,
7,it seems to be of very good quality in its build .,
8,... there are enough moments of heartbreaking honesty to keep one glued to the screen .,

39,it keeps the air clean and nice fresh smelling .,
40,i do n't have an i am sam clue .,
41,but the back side looks nice as well .,
42,"a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours ... a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle .",

44,this keeps the cord out of the way and above the board .,
45,"what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .",

64,a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .,
65,"so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but family fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality .",
66,flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .,
67,the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .,
68,one to another company and two to amazon . com .,
69,"though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .",

126,"feels like one of those contrived , only-in - hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk .",

332,i give it five stars for making eating good so easy !  .,
333,a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been .,
334,i wore this product today for a few hours today .,
335,it 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .,

392,but it didn t do anything for my face .,
393,"the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .",

406,i would not buy this again in the future .,
407,"if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap -lrb- literally -rrb- .",
408,"the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .",
409,what 's most striking about this largely celebratory film ... is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world .,
410,so i purchased another knife sharpener for this our num_num yankee swap .,
411,you 'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot .,
412,it has a num_num year warranty on defects too .,
413,-lrb- u -rrb- nrelentingly stupid .,
414,it is a poor performer when it comes to odor retention and clumping .,

443,there was nothing at all to indicate that belkin manufactured this item .,
444,i bought this product for feeding my num_num persian cats while on vacation .,
445,apparently there are thirteen more words required to successfully submit this review .,
446,abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .,
447,has the feel of an unedited personal journal .,
448,"like the film 's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early - '80s suburbia , it 's significant without being overstated .",
449,a waste of good performances .,
450,"thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings .",

529,"the movie 's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow .",

562,"an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the ` truth ' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to .",
563,"the furious coherence that -lrb- deniro -rrb- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .",
